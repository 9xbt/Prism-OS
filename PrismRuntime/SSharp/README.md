## SystemSharp (S#) V2 documentation

<hr/>

SystemSharp is a high level bytecode language, it currently has no use or goals and is more of a learning experience. SystemSharp is compiled to a custom bytecode that is read and executed by the SystemSharp runtime.

You are free to make your own ports of the SystemSharp runtime and compiler, it is very simple to do as it is mostly ``for`` loops.
