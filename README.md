#### About the project

Prism OS is intended to become a widely used OS that is both fast and safe.

Prism OS uses C# for system functions, like for the filesystem, networking, video, ETC, But We plan to add our very own programing language inspired by many of the currently exising languages.

This project is made possible by Cosmos and the comunity around it, We give huge thanks to all of the developers and contributors that work on cosmos.

#### Why?
Our motivation for this project is the fact most current operating systems are slow, insecure, bloated, have spyware, And the fact that some are still based off of their old kernels written 20+ years ago.

#### Building Prism
Prism OS requires that you are using the latest devkit version of cosmos in order to sucessfuly compile.

##### Step 1: 
Open visual studio and click "clone repo"

##### Step 2:
Copy the URL for this github page and copy it into the "clone repo" text box and click "clone"

##### Step 3:
Wait for the clone process to finish and then open the solution file (PrismProject.sln) from the solution explorer

##### Step 4:
At the top of the screen, you should see an option called "build", click that and the prism will compile!

##### Note:
It is recomended not to distribute modified copies that tamper with security and the look, but you can if you really want to.

Instead, you should do a PR to get whatever feature you want implemented, and you will probably get accepted!
