Prism OS is a [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos) based operating system developed with C#. The operating system is wrapped around an easy to navigate graphical user interface and includes core functionalities such as a filesystem and networking.

This project is made possible by Cosmos and the community around it, and we give a huge thanks to all of the developers that contribute to it.
