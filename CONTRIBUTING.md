#### In order to contribute code to the main repository, it must follow these guidelines:
All functions, local and global variables, and namespaces must be properly capitalised and spelled properly, and they must contain proffesional and easily readable names, usualy they should describe what the function does if possible.
variables and usings should be clustered like this, with descending length:

if a class has a ton of functions, try to caterogize them in between ``@region NAME`` and ``#endregion`` tags.
do not create stupid hacky methods to get around something unless you know you will change it before you commit/pr.
