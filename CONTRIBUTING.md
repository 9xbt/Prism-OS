### In order to contribute code to the main repository, it must follow these guidelines:
#### All functions, local and global variables, and namespaces must be capitalized With The 'PasCal' naming convention, and spelled properly. They must contain professional and easy to read names, usually they should describe what the function does if possible.
###### Variables and usings should be clustered like this, with descending length:

#### If a class has a ton of functions, try to categorize them in between ``#region NAME`` and ``#endregion`` tags.
#### Do not create stupid hacky methods to get around something unless you know you will change it before you commit.
###### (Trust me, You will regret making something very unreliable then having to re-make it for several hours in a more stable manner)
