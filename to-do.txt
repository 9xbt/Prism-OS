More commands. Get inspiration from command prompt or something.

Networking (allow access to the internet to make net requests and stuff)

File access. Reading and writing to disk.

Basic scripting language (like bash or batch)

===================================
For the filesystem I found this:

Must use
using Cosmos.System.FileSystem.VFS;
using Cosmos.System.FileSystem;

Before BeforeRun(); function
CosmosVFS fs = new Sys.FileSystem.CosmosVFS();

Add Inside of BeforeRun();
(This just initiates VFS)
Sys.FileSystem.VFS.VFSManager.RegisterVFS(fs);

When the system boots, it should show that it successfully initialized the filesystem
I'm adding this as you read this.
